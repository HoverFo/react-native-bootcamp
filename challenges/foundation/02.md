# Create your first project with `react-native-paper`

## 📡 What you will learn

- Use the `expo-cli`
- Install a library with `yarn`
- Use VSCode to code from your computer

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode installed on your machine
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
- Star the repository [react-native-bootcamp](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp) on the corner top right. This allows you to easily keep track of updates and new releases, as you will receive notifications when changes are made to the repository.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

- [ ] Copy-paste the following commands in your terminal

```console
yarn create expo-app spacecraft --template expo-template-blank-typescript
```

```console
cd spacecraft
```

- [ ] To preview the app run this and scan the QR Code

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

Next, take a look at the project files in your text editor.

- The `package.json` file lists all available scripts and dependencies. Installing any new library updates this file.
- In every Expo project we also have an `app.json` file, which contains all the metadata for our app. This includes the app's name, bundle identifiers, and more.
- Lastly, we have our `App.tsx` file, which is an entry point for our application. Try changing text inside the `<Text>` component to see the changes immediately apply to the content in our app.

One thing you can do next is create a `src` folder where all our components and screens will be.

During this bootcamp, we are going to use the UI library called `react-native-paper` to have a nice look and feel.

- [ ] From your terminal, install the library with:

```console
yarn add react-native-paper
```

- [ ] From your terminal, install the library `react-native-safe-area-context`to wrap your app with :

```console
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
```

- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

- [ ] Wrap your application with `react-native-safe-area-context` 

It should look like this

```console
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

Now we are going to create another Screen. Fell free to kill/relaunch the expo server if you encounter errors.

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx` and create 2 folders `src` and `screens` like this

```console
.
├── App.tsx
├── package.json
├── src
│    └── screens
│          └── LoginScreen.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`

```javascript
// App.tsx

import React from 'react';
import LoginScreen from './src/screens/LoginScreen';

const App = () => {
  return <LoginScreen />;
};

export default App;
```

Congratulations 👏! You created yout first screen component.

Remember, in **React Native everything is a component**.

It is always a good idea to create small components to your project. In our case we are going to add a `<Header>` component.
They will be used to display important information on the screen.

Create a new folder `components` and a file like this example:

```console
├── src
│    └── components
│          └── Header.tsx
```

And copy your previous `<Header title="SpaceCraft"/>`, or you can take this one

```javascript
// ./src/components/Header.tsx
import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { Text } from "react-native-paper";

export const Header = ({ title }: { title: string }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text variant="headlineMedium" style={styles.headerText}>
        {title}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 4,
    backgroundColor: "red",
  },
  headerText: {
    textAlign: "center",
    marginBottom: 12,
  },
});

```

As you can see we are using the `Text` component exported from `react-native-paper` instead of the Text component from `react-native`. This is because we want to ensure that our text will use the same theme.
